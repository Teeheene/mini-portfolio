				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am <strong>passionate</strong> about coding. I am someone who genuinely enjoys problem solving and building cool stuff, just like this website! I’ve worked with a variety of languages, including C, Java, HTML, CSS, and Python as you can see in my skill chart below. Whether it’s backend logic, or making things look good, I love getting hands-on and figuring it out. I also like exploring how things work, especially now that my current classes are going head first into assembly to understand things at the <em>lowest</em> level.</p>

				<p>I am constantly <strong>learning</strong>. Through all my personal projects, schoolwork, or just experimenting. I always make sure that each work I do is to the best of my ability, so that may I grow from each task. I enjoy learning new languages and tools, especially when I can apply them and build <strong>meaningful apps</strong>. I try to ensure that my code is not only efficient code but also a code made with care. 

				<p>I also have hobbies like crocheting and volleyball. I love <strong>interacting</strong> and collaborating with people, whether it's through social events, group projects or coding outcomes, I always find myself enjoying each step of the way.</p>
